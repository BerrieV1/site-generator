The Westmalle Tripel is a classic Belgian Tripel with a bright golden color and a complex flavor profile. The aroma is floral with a hint of spice, and the taste is fruity with a slightly sweet malt backbone. The mouthfeel is effervescent and creamy, and the finish is dry and refreshing. Overall, this is a delicious and well-crafted beer that is perfect for enjoying on a warm summer evening.
