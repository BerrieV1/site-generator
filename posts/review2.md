The Rochefort 10 is a magnificent Belgian Quadrupel with a deep ruby color and a rich, full-bodied flavor. The aroma is complex with notes of dark fruit, caramel, and chocolate, and the taste is sweet and malty with a warming alcohol presence. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, and the finish is dry and satisfying. This is a beer to savor slowly and appreciate its complexity and craftsmanship.
