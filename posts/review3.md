The St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a complex and flavorful Belgian Quadrupel with a deep mahogany color and a fruity, spicy aroma. The taste is malty and sweet with notes of dark fruit and a hint of bitterness, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The finish is dry and satisfying, and overall this is a well-crafted and delicious beer.
